- RULES FOR CRAZY EIGHTS:

  Deck Used:

  - This game uses 1 standard 52-card deck.

  Goal:

  - The game is played in 3 rounds, with each round ending once a player has
    played the last card in their hand.

  - At the end of each round, all players gain points depending on the cards
    that are left over in their hand (Point rules are explained below).

  - The player who has the least number of points at the end of round 3 is the
    winner!

  Initial Deal:

  - At the start of each round, all players are dealt 5 cards, and 1 card is
    dealt to the discard to determine the starting value and suite.

  Turn Order:

  - The player who goes first is determined randomly at the start of each round.
    Play proceeds clockwise.

  - A player's hand will glow green while it is their turn.

  Playing Cards:

  - On a player's turn, that player must play a card that matches either the
    value or the suite of the top card in the discard pile.

  - On the user's turn, all valid cards in the user's hand will raise up and
    glow white to denote that they can be played.

  - To play a card on the user's turn, the user must click on the card that they
    would like to play. The game will then automatically play the card and
    advance the turn order to the next player.

  Wild Eights:

  - 8s are wild and can be played on any card.

  - After playing an 8, the player then selects a suite to change the top card
    of the discard pile to.

  - If the user plays an 8, a notification will blanket the screen, prompting
    the user the select a suite. The user must then click what suite they would
    like to change the top card of the discard pile to.

  Drawing Cards:

  - If a player does not have a valid card to play in their hand, they must draw
    cards from the deck until they draw a valid card. The player then must play
    the valid card they drew.

  - If the user must draw on their turn, the deck will glow red. The user must
    then click on the deck and the game will automatically draw cards until a
    valid card has been drawn.

  - Once a valid card has been drawn on the user's turn, it will raise up and
    glow white to denote it can be played. The user must then click on the card
    to play it.

  Deck Run Out:

  - If the deck runs out of cards after a player has drawn a card, all cards in
    the discard pile except for the top one will be shuffled and used to create
    a new deck.

  - If the player whose draw prompts this action did not draw a valid card, they
    continue to draw from the new deck pile until a valid card is drawn.

  Scoring:

  - At the end of each round, all players will gain points depending on the
    cards remaining in their hand. The following explains each card's point
    value:
    - As: 1 point
    - Number Cards: Number value of points
    - Face Cards: 10 points
    - 8s: 50 points
